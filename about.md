I am a web developer/designer with a degree in Computer Systems Security. I was working for a Government-Linked Investment Company called Khazanah Nasional Berhad (KNB) at the Petronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur as an Executive Assistant. I am what you would consider a 'jack of all trades' in the world of ICT. I love to discover new experiences to further my passion in all things ICT. Some might consider me a 'one-man army' who is capable of doing many things to accomplish any task given to me. My doors are always open so if you have any enquiries, do let me know. I am open to anything.
